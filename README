Summary
-------

Download fonts directly off a top 20 list of fonts from dafont.com, for 
each sub-category available there.

You can just change the ID range in the script to download fonts of 
different category.


Dependencies
------------

This script has used python library called 
BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup) for parsing 
HTML. If you are a developer, I’d recommend you to try BeautifulSoup. 
It’s got a nice documentation and it’s easy to use.


Usage
-----

1. Clone dafont-dl
2. Open terminal and navigate to the folder where final.py is located.
3. Execute the command (Use python2.7 and not python3)
	$ python final.py
4. A file called downloader.sh would have been generated in the folder.
5. Copy it to the place where you want the fonts to be downloaded.
6. Navigate to that folder in terminal and run the command
	$ sh downloader.sh
7. You’ll have a neatly organized collection of fonts. All you gotta do 
now is extract them from their archives.
